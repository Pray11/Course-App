user story 14, favourites
Where to show the favourites
I'd love to have a link on every page so that a user can easily go to his favourite page

Before that, let's just make one fake favourite page.

data in app.js
render them in favourite.wxml

yeah, this is non-trivial programming.

matching can be digital analysis without visualization

it is all about how favourite page renders the data

1. define the dimension of the time table area
2. draw index on them(Tuesday, Thursday, 6,7,8-11)
3. draw big X on the taken time slot
